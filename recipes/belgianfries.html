     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <strong>Prepare the Potatoes</strong>: Peel and cut the potatoes into evenly sized strips. Soak them in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch, then drain and pat dry.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>First Fry</strong>: Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed pot to 325째F (165째C). Fry the potato strips in batches for 4-5 minutes until they are pale and soft. Remove and let them drain on paper towels.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Second Fry</strong>: Increase the oil temperature to 375째F (190째C). Fry the potatoes again in batches until they are golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Drain on paper towels, season with salt, and serve with your favorite dipping sauces.
